<p>Topics are limited to the top 4 related topics. Currently there are only 2 topic models: default and model=1 (based on CMMI). The API has the ability to add in new topic models, upon request.</p>
<p>Note: Right now users can only access labels for topics and keywords, these are not necessarily “topics.” Queries only pull topic ids, therefore you will need to refer to the topic legend to decode.</p>
