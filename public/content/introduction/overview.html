<p>At the core of the project is the connection between objects (user, organization, proposal, panel, topic and patent). Every object has a unique ID. Star Metrics’ API program enables the user to access individual objects and their relationships, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Identifying information about each proposal ID.</li>
  <li>Finding collaborators across authors and institutions.</li>
  <li>Determining the most popular grant topics by organization and year.</li>
</ul>
<p>Requests for API are limited to 1000 responses per query. </p>
