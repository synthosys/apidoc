<p>The project is a partnership between science agencies and research institutions to document the outcomes of science investments to the public. At the core is the connection between objects (user, organization, proposal, panel, topic and patent). Every object has a unique ID. The API program enables the user to access individual objects and their relationships, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Identifying information about each proposal ID.</li>
  <li>Finding collaborators across authors and institutions.</li>
  <li>Determining the most popular grant topics by organization and year.</li>
</ul>
<p>Requests for API may eventually be limited to 1000 responses per query.</p>
