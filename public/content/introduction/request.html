<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>In terms of granularity: prop &gt; pi &gt; org</li>
  <li>Can search multiple parameters using "&amp;" and multiple terms within the parameters using ","</li>
  <li>If query exceeds 1000 observations, error will appear</li>
  <li>If you choose CSV format, be aware that excel will drop any “0” in front of a number. This means for proposal ids that begin with “0,” they may need to be converted back to their original form before they can be used.</li>
  <li>Also, CSV format separates multiple topic ids with pipes in the same column instead of dividing them into separate columns</li>
  <li>By default, entries with blank values will not be displayed;  those fields disappear.</li>
</ul>
