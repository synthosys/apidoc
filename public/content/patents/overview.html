<p>Based on Lee Fleming's work on patent data disambiguation. The NBER patent database uses an educated guess to match inventor name with NSF record through nsf_id. Patents are up to date only through 2010. Please see <a href="http://readidata.nitrd.gov/star/about_patents.php">http://readidata.nitrd.gov/star/about_patents.php</a> for details. This is a work in progress. </p>
<p>Note: Currently you cannot find patent information through a ”patent” [[object]] except by class breakdown through the “legend” [[params]]. You can, however, find patent details including title, grant_year, and classes filtered through other [[object]]s by using “page=patent” [[params]]. Please refer to “patent” examples in previous “user” and “topic” [[object]] sections.</p>
